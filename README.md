NLP Homework

In this homework, I was able to access news articles via an api, gather top headlines on both Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies, and gauge the general sentiment of the two using a machine learning Natural Language Processing library in Python called VADER. After which, I used the same top headlines from both Bitcoind and Ethereum to find not only the most common words associated with each coin, but the most common 2-word sequences as well. Using the most common words for each coin, I then created a word cloud that graphically displays the same information above.
